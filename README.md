# ham-audio-bridge
 HAM Audio Bridge is a GUI application for handling multiple audio input and output devices and streaming audio data between them using the PyAudio library. Users can select from available input and output devices to start and stop streaming audio between devices. It has the ability to interface with HAM radio equipment, either directly using USB RTS PTT methods or a Digirig, and can transmit audio from a PC mic or other source.
